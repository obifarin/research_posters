## Machine Learning Predicts Renal Cell Carcinoma Status from Urine Using Multiplatform Metabolomics.
I presented a poster at the American Society for Mass Spectrometry Conference 2020 about using machine learning and urine-based metabolomics to detect kidney cancer. The study used machine learning techniques to predict kidney cancer status from metabolomic profiles generated through liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance. The cohort, comprising 82 kidney cancer patients and 174 healthy controls, was divided for training and validation of the machine learning model. The final machine learning model achieved a 98% accuracy rate in distinguishing between healthy controls and cancer patients. This research indicates that renal cell carcinoma diagnosis may be possible through routine urine tests in the future.

## Ovarian Cancer Lipidome Dynamics in a _Dicer-Pten_ Double-Knockout Mouse Model.
My poster presentation at the American Society for Mass Spectrometry (ASMS) Conference 2022

### Introduction
Ovarian cancer (OC) is responsible for more deaths than any other cancer associated with the female reproductive system. In addition, it is the fifth leading cause of cancer-related death in women. This is particularly the case because of the low survival rate associated with late diagnosis coupled with nonspecific symptoms at early stages. Particularly deadly is high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC), the most frequent type of OC. 

### Methods
An HGSC Dicer-Pten Double-Knockout (DKO) mouse model was used to study the dynamics of lipidome changes in this OC subtype. DKO mice mimic many features of the human disease. For example, it originates in the fallopian tube before spreading to the ovary and the abdominal cavity. After two months of breeding, serum samples of DKO (n = 15) and DKO control (n = 15) mice were collected every two weeks for six months. Ultra-high performance liquid chromatography−mass spectrometry (UHPLC−MS) was used for serum lipidomic profiling.  The dynamics of lipidomic changes were studied using univariate statistical methods, hierarchical clustering analysis, machine learning, and survival analysis. 

### Preliminary Results
Eighty-seven significant lipidomic features (Student’s T-test p-value < 0.05) were identified when DKO was compared with DKO control for all time points combined. Given the different death rate profile of control and DKO mice, each time point collection was converted to a percentage of the total lifetime of the individual mice, making the group comparison more robust. Percentage lifetimes were then binned into five different stages (0-30%, 30-45%, 45-60%, 60-75%, and 75-100% lifetime). Hierarchical clustering analysis revealed the clustering of longitudinal lipid abundance trajectories into four selected clusters, associated with distinct lipid phenotypes.  Machine learning was used for DKO classification for the five different stages of OC progression, with the highest classification performance at 46-60% lifetime (Test set ROC AUC = 0.85). Altered lipid levels were observed for fatty acids (FA) and their derivatives, phospholipids, and sphingolipids. Early progression of OC is marked by increased levels of phosphatidylcholines and phosphatidylethanolamines. In contrast, later stages were marked by more diverse lipids alterations, including FA and FA derivatives, triglycerides, ceramides, hexosylceramides, sphingomyelins, lysophosphatidylcholines, and phosphatidylinositols. These alterations provided evidence of perturbations in cell membrane stability, cellular proliferation, and survival. 

### Novel Aspect
Our study provides the first in-depth, longitudinal lipidome dynamics study of ovarian cancer in the DKO mouse model.
